# Tkinter Name Generator

## Purpose

I've created this simple Python application that generates random names based on a given letter. Clicking the "Randomize" button will generate a random name. 

If you are interested in expanding upon this application here are some suggestions:

- Make changes to the first_names.txt file.
- Add a last_names.txt file and create a seperate Last Names option.
- Create an option to filter male and female names.
- Customize font styles, colors, and the layout of the GUI.

## Prerequisites 

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
	```bash
	git@github.com:kmparks60/name_generator.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
	```bash
	cd name_generator
3. Run the script:
	```bash
	python name_generator.py
		or
	python3 name_generator.py
4. Enter a letter in the input field and click "Generate" to genereate names starting with that letter.
5. Click the "Randomize" button to generate a random name regardless of the input letter.
